		Diving club for the south-west UK—let's
		make a splash!

		<h2>
			Welcome to our super-dooper Scuba site
		</h2>
		<p>
		Glad you could drop in and
		share some air with us!
		You've passed your underwater navigation skills and
		successfully found your way to the start point—or
		in this case, our home page.

		<h3>
			About Us
		</h3>
		<p>
		Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based
		in the south-west UK who
		meet up for diving trips in the summer months when
		the weather is good and
		the bacon rolls are flowing.

		We arrange weekends away as small groups to
		cut the costs of accommodation and travel, and
		to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.
		</p>
		<p>
		Although we're based in the south-west,
		we don't stay on our own turf:
		past diving weekends away have included
		trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and
		to Malta's numerous wreck sites.
		</p>
		<p>
		When we aren't diving,
		we often meet up in a local pub to talk about
		our recent adventures
		(any excuse, eh?).
		</p>
