				About Us
			</h2>
			<p>
			Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based
			in the south-west UK who
			meet up for diving trips in the summer months when
			the weather is good and
			the bacon rolls are flowing.
	
			We arrange weekends away as small groups to
			cut the costs of accommodation and travel, and
			to ensure that everyone gets
			a trustworthy dive buddy.
			</p>
			<p>
			Although we're based in the south-west,
			we don't stay on our own turf:
			past diving weekends away have included
			trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and
			to Malta's numerous wreck sites.
			</p>
			<p>
			When we aren't diving,
			we often meet up in a local pub to talk about
			our recent adventures
			(any excuse, eh?).
